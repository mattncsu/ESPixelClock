Collection of code examples for the ESPixelClock

[This](https://github.com/mattncsu/ESPixelClock/tree/master/examples/ESPixelClock) is the code that comes pre-flashed on clocks that shipped with an ESP32 attached.

For those starting off with a bare board, I recommend taking a look at the examples in the [simple](https://github.com/mattncsu/ESPixelClock/tree/master/examples/simple) folder because they'll be easier to adapt to other microcontrollers.

ESP-ready version is now available on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/ESPixel-Pixel-Based-Segment-Display-Raspberry/dp/B08TGLGM2F 
ESP-32 included version on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/ESPixel-Clock-Pixel-Based-Segment-Display/dp/B08XQ449VJ
